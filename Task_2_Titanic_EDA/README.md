# Task 2 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

This notebook explores the Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. The goal was to uncover survival patterns based on passenger demographics and travel class.

## Key Steps
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values
- Visualizing survival rates by gender, age, and class
- Annotated insights for academic clarity

## Tools Used
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Outcome
The analysis revealed strong survival correlations with gender and class, and demonstrated the importance of clean, reproducible EDA workflows.
